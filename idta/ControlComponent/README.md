# Control Component Type and Instance

The Control Component (CC) concept supports the engineering, deployment and orchestration of service-based and component-oriented industry 4.0 automation solutions. The term component in this document refers to a "modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of interfaces" (IEV 741-01-11). In general, a physical device, machine or module can be considered as a component as well as software components, e.g. a function block. Both, the control and the component aspect are meant to be understood in an abstract manner and from a cybernetical viewpoint of the orchestration (process control) of industrial production processes.

## Introduction

There are two specifications defining how control component information should be modelled as Submodels:
- The `Control Component Type` Submodel to describe control component types and
- the `Control Component Instance` Submodel to describe their instances.

Thus, this sub-namespace covers concepts and its semantic ids for  both submodel templates,


## Status: `Submitted`
The sub-namespace for Control Component Type and Instance and its identifiers have been finalized in the respective Taskforce `ControlComponentType and ControlComponentInstance`.

## Versions: [1.0](1/0)
This version is the first version to be officially published by the IDTA Documents `IDTA 020015-1-0 Control Component Type` and `IDTA 020016-1-0 Control Component Instance`.
