# Digital Nameplate Laser Engraving Machine

This sub-namespace collects the identifiers defined in the submodel "Digital Nameplate Laser Engraving Machine", which is under development in the [InterOpera](https://interopera.de/teilmodellprojekte/) project.

## Introduction

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing asset nameplate for a laser engraving machine (LEM). The nameplate information has been modelled generally by the existing IDTA Submodel “Digital Nameplate for Industrial Equipment”, regardless of application domains. For specific types of products, the asset-specific nameplate information is intended to be capsuled in the SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) “GuidelineSpecificProperties” within the SMC “AssetSpecificProperties”. The asset-specific properties have to be defined by the manufacturer. Interoperability cannot be ensured if different manufacturers have different descriptions of the properties for the same product type. The purpose of this document is to standardize the minimum required asset-specific properties of LEM, which should be provided by manufacturers and included in the digital nameplate.
The properties are defined based on the existing EU directives, standards and common practices at enterprises so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved. The defined properties are included in the SMC “AssetSpecificProperties” of the IDTA existing IDTA Submodel “Digital Nameplate for Industrial Equipment” V2.0. Therefore, this submodel "Digital Nameplate Laser Engraving Machine" is an extension of the existing template for LEM. Only the LEM-specific properties are defined in this sub-namespace, which have not been included in the exsiting dictionaries, aka. ECLASS and IEC CDD.

## Status: `Submitted`
The submodel "Digital Nameplate Laser Engraving Machine" is under development. Its specification will be released soon.

## Identifier 1 (ShortId)

Add the ShortId in the headline. We recommend using [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) Notation. Properties, attributes or in general any SubmodelElements start with a lower case, while classes or named entities have a capital first letter. Please arrange the words alphabetically, so start with 'a' and end with 'z'. No numbers or special characters are allowed at the first position.

[https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/version/revision](https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/version/revision) (Add the complete URI of your identifier here. Start with the latest version and revision.) Description: explain what your identifier means and why it is necessary. Give as much information as possiblebut not much more than one paragraph each.


[https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/oldVersion/oldRevision](https://admin-shell.io/template/ShortId/oldVersion/oldRevision) (list all old versions/revisions under the currently valid one.) Description: Explain their meaning and add at least one sentence why you needed to deprecate the identifier.

### Status: `<status>`
The status of this identifier. It can be `Submitted`, `Under Review`, `Refinement Required`, `Accepted`, `Revoked` or `Not Accepted`. The requester can only set the status `Submitted`, all others are managed by the Coordination Board. Default is the status of the subnamespace.


## Identifier 2 (ShortId)

The next identifier of the subnamespace. And so on.

...

## Identifier n (ShortId)

The last identifier of the subnamespace.
