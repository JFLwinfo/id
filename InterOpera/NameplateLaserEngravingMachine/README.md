# Digital Nameplate for Laser Engraving Machine

This sub-namespace collects the identifiers defined in the submodel "Digital Nameplate for Laser Engraving Machine", which is under development in the [InterOpera](https://interopera.de/teilmodellprojekte/) project.

## Introduction

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information describing asset nameplate for a laser engraving machine (LEM). The nameplate information has been modelled generally by the existing IDTA Submodel “Digital Nameplate for Industrial Equipment”, regardless of application domains. For specific types of products, the asset-specific nameplate information is intended to be capsuled in the SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) “GuidelineSpecificProperties” within the SMC “AssetSpecificProperties”. The asset-specific properties have to be defined by the manufacturer. Interoperability cannot be ensured if different manufacturers have different descriptions of the properties for the same product type. The purpose of this document is to standardize the minimum required asset-specific properties of LEM, which should be provided by manufacturers and included in the digital nameplate.
The properties are defined based on the existing EU directives, standards and common practices at enterprises so that a far-reaching acceptance can be achieved. The defined properties are included in the SMC “AssetSpecificProperties” of the IDTA existing IDTA Submodel “Digital Nameplate for Industrial Equipment” V2.0. Therefore, this submodel "Digital Nameplate Laser Engraving Machine" is an extension of the existing template for LEM. Only the LEM-specific properties are defined in this sub-namespace, which have not been included in the exsiting dictionaries, aka. ECLASS and IEC CDD.

## Status: `Submitted`
The submodel "Digital Nameplate Laser for Engraving Machine" is under development. Its specification will be released soon.
